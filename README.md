# DEV-TEST

Hi,

This is my solution for three tasks given by you. As suggested in the description, this is simple console application. I hope it provides correct results :) 

In order to run it just load it to your IDE, download dependecies via Maven and you are ready to go. Starting point is class `com.mkrosnicki.Main'.
